			<span id="readingTitle">A Day At The Beach</span><br>
			Sam and his family go to the beach every summer. During the summer it is sunny and hot. In the morning they eat breakfast. Later they take their bucket and shovel and go to the beach. When they arrive, mom puts sunscreen on Sam and his dad. It is very important to wear sunscreen so that they do not burn their skin. Sam and his dad are making a sandcastle. It is very big and has three towers. Mom lies down in the shade to read a book. After building a sandcastle Sam goes swimming in the sea. The water is very cold. Sam puts on his goggles so that he can see the fish, crabs, and shells under the water. This summer Sam is going to learn how to surf. He likes jumping on the surfboard and riding the waves. Sam's family returns to their hotel in the evening for dinner and Sam takes a nap.
